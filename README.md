#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

I incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In Stage One, I took a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Specification

I was provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code had many issues. Itâ€™s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also did not include any standard accessibility features, and it did not work offline at all. My job was to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.
